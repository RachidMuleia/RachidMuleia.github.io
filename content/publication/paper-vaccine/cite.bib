ABSTRACT = {Background: Mozambique introduced the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) in 2013 using a three-dose primary series with no booster dose (3p+0) and later switched to the PCV13 using a schedule of two primary doses with one booster (2p+1). We aimed to describe the burden and serotype distribution of pneumococcal meningitis in children under 5 years of age in Mozambique over an eleven-year period starting with the year of PCV10 introduction, and assess the impact of the PCV vaccine and schedule changes. Methods: We analysed meningitis surveillance data in Mozambique from March 2013 through to December 2023. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from eligible children in three referral hospitals (Maputo Central Hospital [south], Beira Central Hospital [central], and Nampula Central Hospital [north]). Culture and polymerase chain reaction assay (qPCR) were performed on each sample. S. pneumoniae-positive samples were subsequently serotyped using multiplex assay. We estimated annual incidence rates for pneumococcal meningitis in children under 5 years old following the PCVs’ introduction (2013–2023). The impact of the product switch and schedule change from PCV10/3p+0 to PCV13/2p+1 on the burden and serotype distribution of pneumococcal meningitis was assessed. Results: Of the 4075 CSF samples tested, 7.4% (301/4075) were positive for S. pneumoniae, 2.5% (103/4075) for H. influenzae, and 1.0% (42/4075) for N. meningitidis. Pneumococcal meningitis incidence in children under five reduced from 44.7 cases per 100,000 in 2013 to 4.6 cases per 100,000 in 2023, an 89.7% reduction. In the PCV13/2p+1 period (2020–2023), pneumococcal meningitis incidence was 51.2% lower than the PCV10/3p+0 period (2013–2017) (IRR 0.49, 95% CI 0.4–0.6; p < 0.001). PCV10-serotype pneumococcal meningitis incidence among children under five decreased by 65.6% in the PCV13/2p+1 period (IRR 0.34, 95% CI 0.2–0.6; p < 0.001). We detected zero cases of pneumococcal meningitis due to the PCV13-serotype in 2020–2023, whereas non-PCV10/13-serotypes increased by 76% (IRR 1.76, 95% CI 1.2–2.6; p = 0.004). The case–fatality proportion decreased by 71.9% (95% CI 62.9–84.8%) in the PCV13/2p+1 period. Conclusions: Since the introduction of PCVs in Mozambique, the burden of pneumococcal meningitis and deaths in children under 5 years of age has substantially decreased, as well as the prevalence of PCV13-serotypes. Higher valency PCVs are needed due to the increased prevalence of non-PCV10/13-serotypes.
