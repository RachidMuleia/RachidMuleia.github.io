<div style="text-align: left"> 

I hold a PhD in Statistics from Hasselt University in Belgium. Currently, I am a lecture at [**Eduardo Mondalne University**](https://www.uem.mz) UEM in the department of mathematics and computer science, where I teach under-graduate and graduate students. My research interest revolve around generalized additive models (GAM), spatial modelling, Bayesian inference, statistical programming and infectious disease modelling. I also have a strong interest in climate change and vulnerability assessment and adaptation of the health sector. 

I have been collaborating with a team of researchers at [**National Institute of Health**](https://ins.gov.mz/), who work with key populations, helping them with survey design and statistical analysis to estimate several HIV-related indicators. 


What's more, I'm  an <i class="fab fa-r-project" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#035AA6"></i> enthusiast. Literally, I am an <i class="fab fa-r-project" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#035AA6"></i> evangelist.
